# Alle Website

My personal portfolio built in [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and deployed to [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech/) via [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) ‚ö°.

## Issue

You might run into pathing issues if you try to view the site through an IPFS gateway which has the IPFS hash in the url path. EG: ipfs.io/ipfs/qm‚Ä¶
The simple solution for this is to use [gatsby-plugin-ipfs](https://github.com/moxystudio/gatsby-plugin-ipfs).

## Verify on IPFS

[IPFS](https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmUKgHdLGfFM6Bsst585q4w87FcvPdsyfWKjT73MKYAhoP/)
