## Description

My personal portfolio built in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed to [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech/) via [Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/) ‚ö°.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.mdx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
